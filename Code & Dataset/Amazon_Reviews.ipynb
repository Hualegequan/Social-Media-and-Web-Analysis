Firstly, nothing from Amazon comes undamaged these days. Nothing. The first box was opened. The second box was damaged. But the food looked unharmed. Wasn’t opened. Nothing. So I fed it to my three dogs, and my cat loves to steal their food if any is not eaten. By the very next day ALL FOUR. I repeat, ALL FOUR of my animals were sick. My dogs were pooping blood. Literally. My cat was vomiting and couldn’t even make it to the litter box. My dogs started to vomit and I had endless trips to the vet. Because their food had been messed with.

He's 11 years old, an older dog, and I had researched he may need to eat less and more often throughout the day to keep him from throwing up and having his stomach empty. It seemed to help at first, but even when he was being fed more often he was still throwing up yellow foam. I also have a german shepherd/retriever mix and he has been itching non-stop and his skin has been irritated and red.<br /><br />I've been looking more closely into the reviews for this product and down to even they way the online brand kibble looks (pale and stale looking) to being store bought (darker colored) there has to be something happening with the online products of this brand. I know that Blue brand is a highly recommended dog food with better ingredients than the grocery store brands of dog food, but I definitely recommend you doing your research before purchasing this brand online.

Our vet couldn't find the cause and suggested to switch foods.  We'd been feeding Merrick & Merrick's cheaper brand Whole Earth Farms for years, never thinking it was the food since his potty time was always fine & other than the skin issues he was in great health.  Being so sick & tired of his poor skin problems I gave Blue Buffalo a shot & I gave it several bags before I made a decision as to if it was helping at all or doing nothing.  I figured the food would probably have nothing to do with any of the skin issues and was just taking a shot in the dark picking Blue Buffalo.  I was absolutely shocked that his skin issues are totally 100% gone now - all cleared up & 100% healed!  Now I do want to be super clear here & state that I honestly believe it was the removal of his old food that was what caused this amazing improvement, not the addition of Blue Buffalo.  Hope that makes sense!<br /><br />I mean that, I think any other good quality food would have very likely caused improvement in his skin issues.  I just happened to choose Blue Buffalo & it just happened to work great for us!  It's good quality nutrition, our Aussie seems to like the taste, it's always available here on Amazon & if for some reason I don't want the Chicken & Rice at any point there are plenty other varieties to choose from.  I really love when pet food companies have various kinds & flavors so we can keep our dog's digestive system regular & give him some variety to keep him excited about food!  We can switch between any of the varieties without any fuss because most of them have very similar ingredients. The biggest positive I can report is, we didn't transition him at all from his old food to Blue Buffalo.  So we were expecting some not-so-great potty results.  Nope!  All went smooth & no changes in his digestive system!  We have ALWAYS had major trouble if we didn't switch him slowly, so I was really surprised nothing happened negatively & his food transition went as easy as pie!

Sometimes, when I first open the bag, it even smells almost appetizing to me ;)  I like the small kibble size and the fact that I don't have to feed as large a volume - between 2 and 2-1/2 cups per day for my 50 lb dog. This food is also fairly easy to hydrate and serve wet - I find that pouring very hot water in just about to cover and letting it sit for about a half hour (stirring once about halfway through) before serving works best.<br />My only beef with this stuff is the box size that Amazon uses.  The proper box size for this is probably the 1BG or B11 or P1, and they frequently deliver it in a 3A1 which could probably fit two bags of this.\", 'images': [], 'asin': 'B0009YWKUA', 'parent_asin': 'B0BKXK352T', 'user_id': 'AHPRMLGYJTE6O3XJHT72RMA2OOWA', 'timestamp': 1575589923901, 'helpful_vote': 1, 'verified_purchase': True}\n",

She will absolutely under no circumstances number 2 in the house unless she’s sick and can’t help it, which is what’s currently going on. It has also caused skin irritation, which causes her to bite herself and lick herself a lot. We got her checked for fleas and she didn’t have any.

Up until about a month ago I was meal prepping her food about once a week and keeping it frozen until I needed it. Unfortunately, this is EXTREMELY time consuming and after some changes in our home life, I wasn\\'t able to spend several hours at one time preparing everything. My roommate had picked up some dry kibble that they had gotten at Walmart and immediately I could see her itching EXCESSIVELY. I was worried that maybe somehow she had gotten fleas and would check her every time she would itch, but never saw any fleas or flea dirt. I also started to notice her licking her legs more, which is a self soothing gesture that dogs will do when they are uncomfortable. I suspected that her diet change was a huge part of what was going on and spent hours looking up reasonably priced HEALTHY dog foods. I learned that seeing \"natural\" on a labels is a marketing ploy and that there are all kinds of thing that shouldn\\'t be given to a dog in there ( ex: palm oil ) and that you have to READ the ingredients.<br />I switched to this dog food about 5 days ago (still mixing in with the old food abt 50%) and already I notice the difference. She doesn\\'t immediately start to kick her leg up with you touch her back, I can tell that she is just more comfortable. Also, you can SEE the quality in the kibble. The old food I have is extremely dry and grainy feeling.

Within two weeks she was forming scabs all over her back, getting a potbelly, and puking blood. We rushed her back, as she was never like this during either of her surgeries. The vet recognized it as cushing immediately and asked what we had been feeding her.<br />My mom was my dogs primary owner as the time since I was high-school and let him know one of the assistants recommended Blue Buffalo. Right after saying the vet stormed out of our room and we heard yelling from the front desk until he came back and said it was handled. He told us that he was confident that Blue Buffalo was the reason, citing lead and other harmful substances.<br />Normally I would never blame a dog food, but this vet has taken care of Audi since she was a pup and she is now 11.5 and still living with cushings. There is no cure for this disease, only 100 dollars monthly of medication to treat the symptoms amd hope she goes into remission.<br />This happened 4 years ago and luckily after years of a different food brand, 1200 in yearly meds, and warning others of this food she's been in remission for 2 years. This disease cannot be cured. I've had to watch what was the liveliest dog who had an iron stomach which got her in trouble reduced to scabs that won't go away, an inability to process a large amount of foods without terrible accidents, and a loss of the spark that once was the reason we were able to push to keep her alive after the surgeries. I would die for my dog, and I'm sure many of you would as well..<br /><br />I implore you please, do not give blue Buffalo to your dog.
